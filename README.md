## TODO
- Need to limit the range so that the user cannot enter 0. (This seems to be ok)
- Could have the add and deletion of rows be done with try catch.
- At the moment the price is calculated by adding all the current order prices. This is really inefficient and could be done but getting the current total price and then adding the new order price.
- Do the invoice

## Assume
- The max amount that can be ordered would be done by another section
